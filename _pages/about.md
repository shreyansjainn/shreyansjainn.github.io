i am shreyans.

**i studied civil engineering in undergrad, and learned ML and programming afterwards alongside my job solely due to my interest in maths and problem solving.**

my aim is to work full time on ML interpretability research because personally, i would like to understand more about whats going under the hood of a complex AI system responsible for deciding whether its a dog or a cat or what word i should be typing next. in addition, my interest lies in reinforcement learning, ai ethics as well so i try to keep myself up to date on these topics too.

as of june 1st, i'm on a career break for a couple of months but during this time i've been working on a side research project for **visualizing the training dynamics and latent states of a neural network** as an independent contributor along with a team from NYU.

when i'm not working i'm probably thinking about how i can improve my strength & form in pull-ups and dreaming about muscle ups üèãÔ∏è or learning about the Xs and Os of basketball. i occasionally pick up a book (mainly it's on my kindle :P) too trying to learn more about indian history, world history but won't shy away from a good fiction (sci fi preferred) or some new topic that looks interesting to me.

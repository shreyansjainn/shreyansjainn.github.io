That experiment showed how superposition is introduced in a model by varying the feature sparsity values. However, a uniform sparsity across all the features was considered to keep things interpretable and simple. This post explores the effects of non-uniform sparsity on superposition for a similar experiment setup.</p> <p>This question was listed in Neel Nanda’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LbrPTJ4fmABEdEnLf/200-concrete-open-problems-in-mechanistic-interpretability">200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability</a> post. I’ve been interested in AI Interpretability for a long time but wasn’t sure how to enter the field. I discovered the field of mech-interp recently when I was working on some other project and instantly felt connected to the field. This is my first post on LW and this project is my attempt to increase my comfort working with mech-interp problems and build the necessary reasoning for solving more complex problems.</p> <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1> <p>The ReLU output model is a toy model replication of a neural network showcasing the mapping of features (5 input features) to hidden dimensions (2 hidden dimensions) where superposition can be introduced by changing the sparsity of input features. For a set of input features x∈Rn and a hidden layer vector h∈Rm, where n»m, the model is defined as follows:</p> <p>$h=Wx$</p> <p>$x^′=ReLU(W^{T}h+b)$</p> <p>This model showcases how a large set of input features can be represented in a much smaller dimensional vector in a state of superposition by increasing the sparsity of the input features (sparsity tries to replicate the real-world data distribution where certain concepts are sparsely present throughout the training set). This concept and observations were first introduced in Anthropic’s <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition paper</a>.</p> <p>Before we go ahead with the analysis, let me give you a primer on some important terms we will encounter in this post:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Feature Importance:</strong> Feature importance can be defined as how useful a particular feature is for achieving lower loss. It’s augmented in the ReLU model loss as a coefficient on the weighted mean squared error between the input and the output. $L=∑_x∑_iI_i(x_i−x^′_i)^2$ where $I_i$ is the importance of the feature $i$</li> <li><strong>Feature Sparsity:</strong> Feature sparsity is defined by how frequently a feature is present in the input data. In the ReLU Output model, its defined as the probability of the corresponding element in x being zero. An alternate quantity called <strong>Feature Probability</strong> defined as <strong>1 minus Sparsity</strong> is also used in this formulation.</li> </ul> <p>To summarise the paper’s findings, it showcases that as we increase the sparsity of input features, more features start getting represented in superposition. When sparsity is high, features of higher importance are represented as a dedicated dimension in the hidden layer, but as we increase the sparsity, lower-importance features start getting represented along with higher-importance features in superposition.</p> <p>In the below figures, as we move from left to right, feature sparsity is gradually increased showcasing the transition of how more and more features start getting represented in superposition.</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/x34emadicsfngl2fajcb" width="1100" height="150"/></p> <p>As we increase the feature sparsity from left to right, number of features represented by the hidden layer increases. Yellow represents the feature with highest importance and as we go more green, feature importance decreases</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/uhloldm237fdmdsgtay6" alt=""/></p> <p>Dark colors in the second figure mean feature is represented as a dedicated dimension and as the color transitions to yellow, it indicates feature being in superposition (Source: <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#demonstrating-basic-results">https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html#demonstrating-basic-results</a>)</p> <p>I attempt to extend that representation one step further by considering a non-uniform sparsity instead of a uniform sparsity for input features as not all concepts are equally sparse in a training dataset.</p> <h1 id="experiment-setup">Experiment Setup</h1> <p>In my experiment setup, I’m considering two main levers, namely Feature Sparsity and Feature Importance. As we are considering non-uniform sparsity, its combined effect with feature importance plays an important role in the final result and leads to some interesting findings. To showcase different situations, I’m considering four different scenarios:</p> <ol> <li>Feature with the highest importance has the least sparsity and as we go down feature importance, the sparsity increases</li> <li>Feature with the highest importance has the highest sparsity and as we go down feature importance, the sparsity decreases</li> <li>Random feature sparsity across features</li> <li>Constant feature importance and increasing feature sparsity (similar to Case 1.)</li> </ol> <p>Also, to see the effect of random seed on the final results, every scenario was running eight instances while keeping everything constant.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Similar figures that you will encounter from this point onwards has a slightly different interpretation. All the eight instances in every case have the same distribution of feature sparsity. They are to be interpreted as outputs of different random seeds while every other hyperparameter is kept constant. Feature sparsity is not decreasing as we move from left to right (unlike the preceding figures) in the following figures.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="results">Results</h1> <h2 id="no-of-features-represented">No of Features Represented</h2> <p>In all the scenarios considered with non-uniform sparsity, never once are all the five input features represented in the hidden layer (as we saw in the case of uniform sparsity). No. of feature represented maxes out at 4 and hovers around 3 in a lot of scenarios. The below figure illustrates the phenomena for Case 1, for a detailed view of figures from all the scenarios, refer to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1msBb3iH7JZlUgBkO2P_lF2-byEuqptJPr2zz0mm-LLA/edit?usp=sharing">page</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/dtwjvp3rbii0q1oot04w" width="1100" height="150"/></p> <p>Case 1: Feature with the highest importance (in yellow) has the least sparsity and as we go down feature importance (color gets greener), the sparsity increases</p> <p>Does this mean that in the case of non-uniform sparsity, all the features will never be represented in the hidden layer and we will always lose some concepts?</p> <p>To validate this from a different direction, I tried analyzing the number of features represented in a higher hidden dimension (h = 20, no of input features = 80). To estimate the amount of features represented in the hidden layer, I’m choosing the Frobenius Norm as a proxy. The table below summarises the Frobenium Norm values for all the scenarios considered:</p> <p>We can see, that the Frobenium Norm value in the case of Uniform Sparsity is the highest when compared to all the cases of Non-Uniform Sparsity which indicates the number of features represented when sparsity is uniform will most likely always be higher than when compared to non-uniform sparsity.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th> </th> <th> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Scenario</td> <td>Frob Norm</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Uniform Sparsity (Instance of lowest sparsity)</td> <td>7.55</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Case 1 (Max of all the instances)</td> <td>4.98</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Case 2 (Max of all the instances)</td> <td>6.6</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Case 3 (Max of all the instances)</td> <td>5.75</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Case 4 (Max of all the instances)</td> <td>6.43</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="effects-on-superposition">Effects on Superposition</h2> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/iog1knqs63a6sglbvr32" alt=""/></p> <p>Superposition comparison between different cases considered. Purple color indicates features in dedicated dimension, green indicates feature in superposition with less interference, yellow indicates features in superposition with more interference. Blank indicates features not represented in hidden layer.</p> <p>In Case 1, we see the lowest feature representation and the least amount of superposition (showcased in yellow) which was an expected outcome as we are assigning the least amount of sparsity to the most important features. The blanks in the below figure indicate a particular feature is not represented at all in the hidden layer.</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/cwgl3q0y59ua2h77ojan" width="1200" height="450"/></p> <p>Case 1: showcasing more important features getting dedicated dimensions (in purple), while lower importance features are in superposition (in yellow). Blanks indicates features not represented in the hidden layer.</p> <p>Case 2 was pretty interesting as we noticed that all the features represented are always in superposition and none of the features is ever represented as a dedicated dimension irrespective of feature importance.</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/f3nb3zcfitybpm8lhgkm" width="1200" height="450"/></p> <p>Case 2: showcasing all the features (in yellow) in superpositon. Blanks indicates features not represented in the hidden layer.</p> <p>Case 3 is the closest we come to a real-world scenario, where feature sparsity is distributed randomly across features, irrespective of their importance. It looks like an averaged-out scenario of Cases 1 &amp; 2 and strikes an approx. midpoint between dedicated dimensions vs superposition when representing features.</p> <p>What exact combination of feature sparsity and feature importance governs this behaviour is something I wasn’t able to answer in my analysis and I think it’ll be an important question to answer as it can help us interpret the feature representations in real-world models.</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/hd726erhv7bvkonjxpzu" width="1200" height="450"/> Case 3: Some features are represented as dedicated dimension (in purple) and some are in superposition (in yellow)</p> <p>To check a clear effect of sparsity on superposition, we consider Case 4 where we keep the feature importance constant and consider an increasing sparsity (similar to Case 1.)<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/effects-of-non-uniform-sparsity-on-superposition-in-toy#fngbx9ncdu8cc">[1]</a></p> <p>In this case, we stumble on a weird observation where the few features with the least sparsity are not even learned and represented in the hidden layer. The representation starts after a couple of features where all of the represented features (barring a few exceptions due to random seed) are in superposition all the time.</p> <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WwxG8RRHrorJgpoAk/f9vquqtgfuklzbryv5lb" width="1200" height="450"/></p> <p>Case 4: Constant feature importance with increasing sparsity (as we go from top to bottom). Darker color (Green or dark blue) indicates less interference from other features meaning the feature is somewhat in superposition but to a lesser extent compared to features in yellow.</p> <p>Presently, I don’t have a clear intuition on why this is the case but this is quite a contrary observation compared to my expectation.</p> <p>Additionally, this scenario also gives us an intuition that feature importance has a bigger contribution in deciding whether a feature is represented as a dedicated dimension or not when compared to sparsity.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mech-interp,"/><category term="superposition"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Repost from LessWrong, check out th LW post here]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Myth of ‘Are you Doing Enough?’</title><link href="https://shreyansjainn.github.io/blog/2024/are-you-doing-enough/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Myth of ‘Are you Doing Enough?’"/><published>2024-10-08T12:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2024-10-08T12:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://shreyansjainn.github.io/blog/2024/are-you-doing-enough</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://shreyansjainn.github.io/blog/2024/are-you-doing-enough/"><![CDATA[<p>In the past 8 years, my career trajectory has been a roller coaster of unreal magnitude. People looking from the outside might feel like I’ve made some insane progress, and my life is pretty sorted with decent savings, good work, and a stable (relatively) personal life. But during all this, my experience from my POV has been a different picture altogether. There has been one nagging question bothering me all the time: <strong>“ARE YOU DOING ENOUGH?”</strong> because to be honest, it never felt like I was.</p> <p>Just to give you some background, I’m a civil engineering graduate without any foundational CS, math or statistics knowledge and have been working as an Applied Data Scientist for the past 8 years. As of 2024, I’ve been interested in AI safety and ethics research for the past 3 years and really want to crack into it. So in a nutshell, for all my professional life, I’ve been playing catchup with whatever I’ve wanted to do. Initially, it was with ML fundamentals and trying to learn as much variety as possible, be it forecasting, recommender systems, search, deep learning, reinforcement learning, <strong>YOU JUST NAME IT!!</strong> If it involved math and CS somehow, I would be interested in that. Never once, did I felt like sitting comfortably wherever I was and just enjoy life.</p> <p>So an obvious by-product of all this juggling was a constant comparison with other folks present in the field and obviously (me being me!! 😕), the comparison was with accomplished folks in the field who have been working in that niche for multiple years (in other words, <em>WAY MORE TIME THAN ME!!</em>). I always had this urge to be able to learn all the tricks of that trade immediately and just master that niche.</p> <p>During all the comparative analysis I did to determine how I could reduce the gap between me and others (while obviously ignoring the obvious ones 🤪), I just put my foot on the gas pedal and was at it studying or working on projects, but at the end of the day, it never felt like I was doing enough to catch up, and whenever I compared again with others, I was always on a backfoot. This idea got ingrained in me so much that I almost believed that their systems were optimized to unreal extents in terms of productivity, focus and yield and to chase that I literally gave up on my hobbies and all kinds of entertainment (read as “rest” or “break”) but that feeling never went away.</p> <p>My mind wasn’t far behind in playing games either, it always moved benchmarks and goalposts while doing any kind of comparison, just so that I could arrive at the conclusion that <strong>I’m not doing enough!!</strong></p> <p>I still struggle with this idea to this day and there are days I spiral like the bestest lattu you’ve ever seen in your life. But slowly I’m getting to terms with the realisation that there is a high probability if you are asking yourself this question, <strong>YOU ARE DOING ENOUGH!!!</strong> already. The fact you are introspecting and trying to better yourself indicates that you have already explored lots of ideas and you are on the right path.</p> <p>In the end, I would just recommend one thing, don’t give up on your hobbies and fun projects, they make you a complete and interesting human being, because on the work side <strong>YOU ARE ALREADY DOING ENOUGH!!</strong>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past 8 years, my career trajectory has been a roller coaster of unreal magnitude.
